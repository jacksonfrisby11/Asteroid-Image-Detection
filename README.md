# Asteroid Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the full code, dataset resources, and outputs for a project exploring asteroid classification using two machine-learning approaches:

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on asteroid images

A Decision Tree / Random Forest model trained on metadata

The project demonstrates data cleaning, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comparison between image-based and metadata-based learning.
